# Migrate from OneNote to Outline

Suddenly I needed to migrate from OneNote to Outline.
Unfortunately, there is no export to markdown in OneNote, and no easy way to import an archive of `.docx` files into Outline (at least it didn't work for me).

So I wrote this script to pull notes from OneNote and push them into Outline.
Quite stupid solution, but it worked for me.
